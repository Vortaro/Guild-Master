This is a game that aims to create an alternate world with a level of technology
similar to that in medieval times.  In this world you run a trading company that
handles land and maritime trade.

***This program is in the pre-alpha stage, so it is subject to amazing changes 
and numerous planned features.  These features include a robust trading system 
consisting of land and sea trade, random generation of the game world, control 
of subordinate traders, city-states, wars, and gaining political office through
your success, and lots of other smaller things, none of which include a gui!
